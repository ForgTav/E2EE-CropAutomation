# üå± E2EE Crop Automation for OpenComputers + IC¬≤

Automate your IC¬≤ crop breeding with ease using this fully integrated OpenComputers (OC) system. These scripts handle: **tiering up**, **stat maximization**, and **crop spreading** ‚Äî all with minimal setup. No prior experience with OpenComputers is necessary ‚Äî this guide walks you through everything step-by-step.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual-only Crops

Some plants **cannot be automated** using this script due to their unique environmental requirements or mechanics.

### Example: Redwheat
- Requires **light level between 5 and 10**
- This condition cannot be reliably maintained or managed by the robot
- As a result, Redwheat must be grown and bred **manually**

If a plant has similar constraints, it is recommended to handle it outside the automated system.

## üåæ Setting Up the Farm

Choose a location with high **humidity** and **air quality** (e.g., Jungle or Swamp at Y=130). Avoid placing solid blocks above the crops to maintain air quality. Ideally, keep everything inside a single chunk for easier chunk loading.
![Farm Top](media/prepare_farm.png?)
Key setup details:

- The robot should face the **rightmost column** of the working farm.
- Next to the charger:
  - A **chest or drawer** for crop sticks
  - A **trash can** or optional recycling chest
- Place the **transvector dislocator** to face the **blank farmland** (used as a teleport buffer between working and storage farm).
   - ![Face side](media/transvector_dislocator_face.png?)

### Water Placement Guidelines

- Water can go anywhere ‚Äî but for **autoTier mode**, use the suggested layout.
- **Each water source must be covered** (e.g., any solid block, lily pad or trapdoor).
- **Water blocks cannot be adjacent** to each other.

### Seeding the Farm

- Manually place the starter crops in a **checkerboard** pattern.
- One seed is enough ‚Äî the system will multiply it by itself.
- The first farmland slot in front of the charger must have a crop planted. This acts as a reference point for the system to identify the target crop.
- If you don't have IC¬≤ seedlings, start with reeds.
![Ready farm](media/ready_farm.png?)

### Soil Structure

- Below each farmland tile: `farmland ‚Üí dirt ‚Üí dirt ‚Üí nutrient block`
- Example: diareed crops require diamond blocks at the bottom ‚Äî **only** in storage farm.

## üöÄ Running the System

Enter the following command in the computer's terminal:

```bash
main
```
The installation will be checked for correctness and the interface will open, otherwise it will open a step-by-step installation guide

### üîÑ Grid Handling
Each automation mode uses its own logical grid size for optimal performance:

- AutoTier ‚Üí works on a 6√ó6 grid

- AutoStat ‚Üí works on a 5√ó5 grid

- AutoSpread ‚Üí works on a 5√ó5 grid

You do not need to manually change or reconfigure your actual farm layout ‚Äî
the system automatically adapts to the proper working area depending on the selected mode.

### Mode: autoStat

Automatically boosts target crop traits until **(Growth + Gain - Resistance ‚â• 52)**. You can edit these metrics in the UI settings tab. Crops exceeding this are treated as weeds and removed.

### Mode: autoTier

Crosses plants and automatically transfers newly bred crops to the storage area upon detection.
This mode includes two sub-modes:

- **Schema Mode:** Breeds according to a set pattern.
  - ![schema_crop](media/schema.png?)
- **Manual Mode:** The robot does not edit parent seedlings unless they are weeded.

### Mode: autoSpread

Duplicates the target crop and transfers to storage.

## üß≠ User Interface
![ui](media/ui.png?)

**The interface contains 5 tabs:**

1. **Farm**  
   This tab allows you to monitor the current state of your farm in real-time.  
   - Click on any farm slot to view detailed information about the plant occupying it.  
   - Displays additional data such as the number of available crop sticks and the fill status of the chest or trash containers.

2. **System**  
   This tab provides system controls where you can:  
   - Check the current status of the automation system.  
   - Start or shuts down the entire system.

3. **Actions**  
   Contains four key actions for managing your farm manually:  
   - **Transplant** ‚Äî Select a plant from one slot and move it to another. This is especially useful for changing the `targetCrop` or when operating in AutoTier Manual Mode.  
   - **CleanUp** ‚Äî Initiate a cleanup process to remove leftover crop sticks and unwanted plants (all plant children). It‚Äôs recommended to run this after stopping the system to prevent weed overgrowth.  
   - **Scan Farm** ‚Äî Force a scan of the farm to update all plant data immediately.  
   - **Scan Storage** ‚Äî Force a scan of the storage farm to update all plant data immediately.
   - **Scan Cropsticks chest** ‚Äî Scan the crop sticks chest to update the internal count.

4. **Settings**  
   Here you can configure different operating modes and logging parameters to adapt the system behavior to your needs.

5. **Logs**  
   View detailed reports of the system‚Äôs actions and events. The log output depends on the selected logging settings and provides insights for troubleshooting and monitoring.

**Loading**

- When the system prepares a new order for the robot, the phrase "Loading.." appears in the bottom left corner. During this time, the user interface becomes unresponsive.

![Schema_Beta](media/ui_loading.png?)

## üí• Force Termination

The system may automatically **terminate** itself under critical conditions to maintain stability:

#### Conditions:
- üßØ Crop sticks fall below **one full stack**
- üì¶ Storage farm is **completely full**

#### What happens:
- üßπ A **forced cleanup** will run automatically to remove any unnecessary crops or leftover sticks.
- ‚ùå The system will **shut down** immediately after cleanup to prevent weed infestation or system failure.

> This mechanism protects your farm from becoming unstable due to missing resources or overflow.  
> If force termination occurs frequently, check your crop stick supply and make sure unused storage slots are available.  
> The logs will show the reason for the stop.

> üí° **Note:** If the system doesn't allow you to start after a forced shutdown, open the **Actions** tab and run a scan of either the **storage** or the **cropsticks chest**.  
> This will reset the error flag and allow the system to resume normal operation.
---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

**1. Transvector Dislocator teleports randomly**\
üí° Cover all water blocks to avoid targeting issues.  
üí° Make sure that the Transvector Dislocator is pointed at the blank farm.  

**2. Robot gets displaced**\
üí° Make sure dislocator faces **forward**, not **up**.

**3. Robot destroys placed crops**\
üí° Resistance >2 or Growth > 23 or Gain > 31 is treated as weed.

**4. Crops dying, weeds spreading**\
üí° Location may have poor humidity/air/soil ‚Äî consider relocating.

**5. Computer can't communicate with the robot**  
üí° Disassemble the robot and remove the **Linked Cards** from both the robot and the computer. Combine them in a **crafting table** to synchronize the connection, then reinsert and try again.

**6. Robot doesn‚Äôt respond**\
üí° Mekanism energy cube or cables may not power the OC charger properly.  

**7. The robot and computer stopped unexpectedly and shut down**  
üí° This is likely caused by the chunk being unloaded. Make sure the farm is inside a **chunk-loaded area**.  
Install a **chunk loader** (e.g., from the IC¬≤ mod or another mod that provides chunk loading).

## üß∞ Helpful Commands

```bash
ls                  # List installed files
edit <file>.lua     # Edit or create script
rm <file>           # Delete file
uninstall           # Remove automation system
```
